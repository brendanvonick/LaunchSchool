//  1. OOP refers to problem solving with a series of object that interact with
//  each other to accomplish a task. Objects with state and behavior work together
//  to accomplish said task.

//  2. OOP lets programmers think about programs at a higher level of abstraction.
//  It lets programmers write programs that reduce dependencies and makes
//  maintenance easier. When done right it makes code flexible, easier to
//  understand and easier to change. On the flipside, it doesn't always lead to
//  smaller programs or more efficient code, in fact, OOP programs are often
//  much larger programs, can require more memory, more disk space and more
//  computing power.

//  3. Encapsulation refers to the idea of bundling or combining the data and
//  operations that work on that data into a single entity, e.g. an object. It's
//  about bundling data (state) and behavior (operations) to form an object.

//  4. In most other OOP languages, encapsulation refers to restricting access
//  to the state and certain behaviors, an object only exposes the data and
//  behaviors that other parts of the appliction need to work (objects expose a
//  public interface for interacting with other objects and keep their
//  implementation details hidden). JavaScript doesn't support access restrictions
//  and although there is a way to provide a degree of access restrictions,
//  they aren't perfect.
